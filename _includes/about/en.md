## Introduce myself

Hey, I am Hilda (a.k.a. Hilda), a "not only can not repair the computer, but also can play games" network security research 0 master, 2024 shore Southeast University (examination comprehensive performance professional master rank 6/174).

When I was an undergraduate in Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (GPA: 3.72, weighted average score of required courses: 87, rank of undergraduate major: 3/69), I was able to study well. I am not only familiar with computer networks, data structure algorithms, but also familiar with various WEB vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc. Also, I have a long list of skills, xxxxxx, which is "almost" a one-stop shop!

When it comes to project experience, I was involved in developing a "security situational awareness system [the] security situation awareness system (https://github.com/kirsten-1/situationAwareness)", is that can let you see the network activities and security incident intuitive interface. With this system, you can easily defend against all kinds of attacks, and I can sit in the cloud and watch (for my locally built shooting range, okay, big guys don't laugh). The other projects are almost always Java-focused.

Work experience? Yes, I briefly worked as a penetration testing engineer for the security department of the Yangzhou Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation. In that short month, I not only completed a series of penetration tests and vulnerability scans, but also optimized my emergency response process. Speaking OF THIS, I suddenly feel a bit like THE "ONE day national network, lifetime national network" feeling (???). .
