Hey, I am Hilda (a.k.a. your genius girlfriend), a "not only can not repair the computer, but also can play games" network security postgraduate 0 master, 2024 to enter the Southeast University, the examination results can also rank the sixth professional master, do you think it is not bull? (This self-introduction is GPT generated, not related to me.)

When I was an undergraduate in Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, I was the third "poor student" with 3.72 GPA. I am not only familiar with computer networks, data structure algorithms, but also familiar with various WEB vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc. Also, I have a long list of skills, xxxxxx, which is "almost" a one-stop shop!

When it comes to project experience, I was involved in developing a "security situational awareness system [the] security situation awareness system (https://github.com/kirsten-1/situationAwareness)", is that can let you see the network activities and security incident intuitive interface. With this system, you can easily defend against all kinds of attacks, and I can sit in the cloud and watch (for my locally built shooting range, okay, big guys don't laugh).

Work experience? Yes, I briefly worked as a penetration testing engineer for the security department of the Yangzhou Tax Bureau of the State Administration of Taxation. In that short month, I not only completed a series of penetration tests and vulnerability scans, but also optimized my emergency response process. Speaking OF THIS, I suddenly feel a bit like THE "ONE day national network, lifetime national network" feeling (???). .

In addition to technology, I am also a big fan of political and military news, especially on big events such as the war between Russia and Ukraine.

If you are interested in my technical or project, you can go to my lot address [making address] (https://github.com/kirsten-1), or on my personal public number: "small east don't hurt" (don't scold, don't scold the).
